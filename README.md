# Honest Games Reviews

This project was created for gamers and people who loves to share their experiences playing video games around the world. Some of the applications to play online, have a dedicated section per game, so that they can make reviews and post them, but most of them are limited by diferent restrictions on what you can or can't write on it.

In **Honest_Games_Reviews**, users are able to create a separate account, and they are able to share what they think of the games they are playing; other users are able to see this reviews, and share also what they think of them, or even ask and add them by *gamer_tag* to their respective consoles, so that they can play together or even against each other.
